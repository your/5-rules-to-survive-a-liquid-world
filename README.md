# 5 rules to survive a liquid world

## 1. Be resilient
Use any damaging power to recover, immediately. Be a stuntman. Life is ahead. No, don't think. Stop being a fucking victim of every situation. *Gne gne*. Stop crying. Focus. React. Move the fuck on.

## 2. Be patient
Complex systems are not built overnight, yet once in place, the outcome can be massive and mostly self-sustainable. Don't go for silly and immediate pleasures all the time. Focus.

## 3. Be dedicated
Focus.

## 4. Be brave
Stand out in the crowd when everyone is making a step back just for fear of the consequences. Let those legs shake for a moment, and prove them that they were wrong. Winners are not afraid of anything but losing.

## 5. Be pragmatic
Sometimes you just have to run, no matter what. Then run. Can you feel the breeze? I am telling you, run.
